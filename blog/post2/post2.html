                <p>This week I'm working on some visualization using Three.js. I was inspired by an example of minimalistic flocking birds, and I'm going to try and recreate it without looking at their source.
                </p>

                <p>Step one, let's figure out how to display geometry on the screen. It looks like you can specify vertices and faces, and add them to a mesh to render. I set up the the initial bird<span name="airplane"></span> prototype with triangles.</p>

                <aside name="airplane">Looks more like a paper airplane but bear with me.</aside>
                <img class="postImage" src="bird.png" alt="Img"></img>

                <p>Now that there's one bird, we just need MORE. I created 100 bird meshes and placed them in random positions on the screen. The birds rotation euler values can be set to random numbers between 0-360 to specify a random rotation.
                </p>

                <img class="postImage" src="manybirds.png" alt="Img"></img>

                <p>Birds<span name="airplane2"></span> usually aren't frozen still, so I gave each bird a 1% chance to lerp to a new rotation per frame. Then, I added a translation in the direction that the bird is facing, to produce animation.
                </p>

                <aside name="airplane2">Ok I'm sorry they really do look like paper airplanes.</aside>

                <video autoplay loop>
                    <source src="swarm.webm" type="video/webm">
                </video>

                <p>That was a pretty fun intro to Three.js for me. This is my first project using JavaScript, and I'm starting to appreciate the flexability it offers. The rendering speed of WebGL was also a pleasant surrpise. Even with 1,000<span name="crash"></span> bird objects on the screen running un-optimized movement code, the Chrome page was still running at a smooth 60fps.
                </p>

                <aside name="crash">Then my insatiable curiosity made me plug in 10,000, and my laptop suddenly erupted into flames.</aside>

                <p>In the next section I'd like to work on making the birds more interactive. We're still missing flapping, and maybe a prettier background would be nice. Another idea is to implement a simple flocking or pathfinding AI. To be continued...
