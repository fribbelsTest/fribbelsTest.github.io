                <p>Finally got around to starting my own blog! I going to take a big <span name="dive"></span>dive into web development this year and see what comes of it. This is my first foray into HTML/CSS/JS and I'm pretty excited to dig deeper into some more web development. A large chunk of my week has been spent fighting a war of attrition against my own stylesheet, but things are starting to look good after letting the dust settle a bit.

                <p>My loosely drawn out goal is to keep this devblog running, and keep it updated. It'd be nice to have a pretty place to post some of my work, because Github READMEs can really only get you so far. I will aim for one or two posts a week, and I will try my best to commit to the blog more than I did for my <span name="resolution"></span>new years resolution. The accompanying portfolio page is also under construction, and that'll be the home for all my content. 
                </p>

                <p>This first post is just going to be me spewing out any coherent thoughts that comes out of my head, but in the future each post will be structured around a small project that I've worked on. I think the next couple will be focused on the terrain generation engine that I wrote in Unity, and that will hopefully get me re-accimated with writing long pieces of prose. 
                </p>

                <p>After that, I'd like to start a new project each week with a different technology. I've been looking at JavaScript libraries like D3.js and three.js to do some visualization work. I have a couple ideas in mind with fancy-ing up the portfolio, and I'm really excited to get started!
