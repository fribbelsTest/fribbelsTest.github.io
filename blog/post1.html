                <p>Back in 2015, I was really addicted to Clash of Clans. I think the clan wars update had just come out, and suddenly the game got a lot more competetive. Everyone I knew was trying to reach the top of the rankings and of course, that takes a lot of time and effort.
                </p>

                <p>The main source of income in the game was raiding other players' bases for loot. Using some crude estimates, every "good" raid took maybe 3 minutes of searching and 2 minutes of attacking. Each good raid would net around 250,000 resources. In comparison, the cumulative cost of a single wall at Th9 back then was about 5,000,000 resources.
                </p>

                <p>That sums up to about 100 minutes per wall... and there were 250 walls. In the end it comes out to about 400 hours of straight raiding to max out just the walls Th9, not even including any of the other upgrades. So I figured, this game is fun and all, but I don't really want to spend hundreds of hours trying to upgrade things.
                </p>

                <p>I tried out a few of the bots floating around the web, but a lot of them were dumb. I saw some that just randomly deployed troops, or dropped down a line of troops and waited, or just plopped everything in one spot and hoped for the best. That really wasn't good enough.

                <p>After some research, I found a conputer vision library called OpenCV. One of the features it provides is image recognition, as displayed above. Given an image and a template, it could find the location where a match is found.
